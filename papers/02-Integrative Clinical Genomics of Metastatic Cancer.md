### Integrative Clinical Genomics of Metastatic Cancer

* The most prevalent genes somatically altered in metastatic cancer included TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and RB1. 
* Tumour metastasis is the process by which cancer cells disperse from a primary site and progressively colonize distant organs. In over 90% of cases, metastatic spread of tumour cells is the greatest contributor to deaths from cancer.
* With the advent of genomic testing of tumours, there remains the promise of matching patients to the right therapy on the basis of comprehensive molecular profiles of pathogenic somatic and germline variants, and components of the functional genome, tumour phenotype, and tumour microenvironment afforded by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
* Metastatic tumours share key driver mutations with the primary tumour from which they arise but often develop new mutations as they evolve during metastasis and treatment. Thus, it is preferable to match patients to potential therapies and clinical trials on the basis of a real-time analysis of their metastatic tumour, rather than archival material of their primary tumour.

* The most prevalent sites of metastases includes the liver, the lymph nodes, the lungs, the bones, and abdominal mass/ascites/pleural fluid.
* Paired-exome sequencing was performed on tumour and germline DNA to identify likely pathogenic variants and resolve their somatic or germline origin.
* For most cancer types, the number of mutations significantly increased in metastases relative to primary tumours in TCGA. The difference was more pronounced for tumour types with low mutation burden in the primary stage, for example prostate or adrenal cancer. To identify the most recurrent, and hence likely pathogenic, targets of genetic alterations, an integrative analysis of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy-number variants (CNVs), and gene fusions was performed. For each patient and gene, the most recurrently mutated genes were classified as putative tumour suppressors or oncogenes on the basis of the increase in frequency of inactivating mutations and expert knowledge.

* A long-tailed mutational spectrum was found for both tumour suppressors and oncogenes. TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, and RB1 were the most frequently altered tumour suppressors, while the most frequently mutated oncogenes included PIK3CA, AR, and KRAS.
* Overall, tumour suppressors were altered across many cancer types (for example, TP53 and RB1), while oncogenes were more strongly associated with individual cancer types (for example, AR or GNAS).

* To characterize the phenotype of host immune responses, exome, RNA-seq, and a dedicated assay for T cell repertoire profiling was leveraged. On the basis of immune-cell markers, an RNA-seq-based score, MImmScore, was developed to assess the magnitude of leukocyte infiltration.
* It was found that MImmScore was negatively correlated with tumour content, and positively correlated with stromal infiltration.
* MImmScore was compared with canonical T-cell expression markers (RNA-seq-based) and DNA-based T-cell receptor-β (TCRβ) CDR3 sequencing: all three analyses were in good agreement.
* It was found that metastatic immune infiltration was strongly determined by tumour type and to a lesser degree by biopsy site.
* Cancer types known to be infiltrated in the localized stage, including kidney cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, remained infiltrated at metastatic sites. Less immunogenic types, such as breast and prostate cancers, were generally associated with a lower MImmScore in the primary and metastatic stages.
* Immune infiltration was found to be heterogeneous not only across cancer types but also within individual cohorts.
* Strikingly, individual patients with high levels of immune infiltration could be identified even within tumour types that did not thus far respond to immunotherapies.

* Mutations in DNA repair pathways have therapeutic implications: hypermutated tumours may respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, while HR deficiency could suggest sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.
* The high prevalence of likely pathogenic germline variants suggests that metastatic patients should be considered for genetic counselling and associated germline testing.
* By integrating whole-exome sequencing with RNA-seq, it was demonstrated that transcriptome profiling provides clinically important and complementary molecular information.
* It was demonstrated how RNA-seq can be used in a clinical context to characterize gene fusions, outlier gene expression, transcriptional pathways, and the immune microenvironment.

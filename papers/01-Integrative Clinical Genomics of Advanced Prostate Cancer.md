### Integrative Clinical Genomics of Advanced Prostate Cancer

* Prostate cancer is among the most common adult malignancies.
* Some men will develop metastatic prostate cancer and receive primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, nearly all men with metastatic prostate cancer develop resistance to primary ADT, a state known as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
* Multiple ‘‘second generation’’ ADT treatments, like abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, have emerged for mCRPC affected individuals; however, nearly all affected individuals will also develop resistance to these agents.

* Multiple studies have identified recurrent somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and oncogenic structural DNA rearrangements (chromoplexy) in primary prostate cancer. These include point mutations in SPOP, FOXA1, and TP53; copy number alterations involving MYC, RB1, PTEN, and CHD1; and E26 transformation-specific (ETS) fusions, among other biologically relevant genes.
* Although certain primary prostate cancer alterations or signatures have prognostic clinical significance, the therapeutic impact of primary prostate cancer genomic events has not yet been realized.

* There is a high frequency of AR pathway alterations in mCRPC, which implies that the vast majority of mCRPC affected individuals remain dependent on AR signaling for viability.
* The ‘‘second-generation’’ AR-directed therapies (e.g., abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide) may select for distinct phenotypes that may be indifferent to AR signaling, and prospective characterization of such cases will be of particular interest.

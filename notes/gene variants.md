### Gene Variants
A gene variant is a permanent change in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. This type of genetic change used to be known as a gene mutation, but because changes in DNA do not always cause disease, it is thought that gene variant is a more accurate term. Variants can affect one or more DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in a gene.

#### Type of Gene Variants

##### A. Classification based on cell type
* `Germline variants` are variants in egg or sperm cells, and are able to be passed from parent to offspring.
* `Somatic variants` are present only in specific cells and are generally not hereditary. Somatic variants are acquired at some point during a person’s lifetime, often due to environmental factors or errors in cell division. Some somatic variants will lead to the development of diseases such as cancer. Both germline and somatic variants have been implicated in many cancers. 

##### B. Classification based on type of alteration
* `Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)` or `Single base-pair substitution` — this is a substitution of a single nucleotide for another. It can be `transition` (interchange of the purine (Adenine/Guanine) or pyrimidine (Cytosine/Thymine) nucleic acids) or `transversion` (interchange of a purine and pyrimidine nucleic acid).
* `Double nucleotide polymorphisms (DNPs)`
* `Triple nucleotide polymorphisms (TNPs)`
* `Insertion` — this changes the DNA sequence by adding one or more nucleotides to the gene. As a result, the protein made from the gene may not function properly.
* `Deletion` — this changes the DNA sequence by removing at least one nucleotide in a gene. Small deletions remove one or a few nucleotides within a gene, while larger deletions can remove an entire gene or several neighboring genes. The deleted DNA may alter the function of the affected protein or proteins.
* `Deletion-Insertion` — this variant occurs when a deletion and insertion happen at the same time in the same location in the gene. In a deletion-insertion variant, at least one nucleotide is removed and at least one nucleotide is inserted. However, the change must be complex enough to differ from a simple substitution. The resulting protein may not function properly. A deletion-insertion (delins) variant may also be known as an insertion-deletion (indel) variant.
* `Frameshift` — if the length of an indel is not a multiple of three, then it will likely result in a frameshift. A frameshift changes the reading frame of all the remaining bases resulting in the rest of the gene being incorrectly translated. This will drastically alter the product of translation, often leading to targeted decay of the mRNA .
* `Copy number variation` — this is a duplication or deletion that changes the number of copies of a particular DNA segment within the genome. Structural variations have been implicated in a number of conditions, including polycystic kidney disease, cardiomyopathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and some cases of intellectual disability.
* `Duplication` — this occurs when a stretch of one or more nucleotides in a gene is copied and repeated next to the original DNA sequence. This type of variant may alter the function of the protein made from the gene.
* `Repeat expansion` — some regions of DNA contain short sequences of nucleotides that are repeated a number of times in a row. For example, a trinucleotide repeat is made up of sequences of three nucleotides, and a tetranucleotide repeat is made up of sequences of four nucleotides. A repeat expansion is a variant that increases the number of times that the short DNA sequence is repeated. This type of variant can cause the resulting protein to function improperly.

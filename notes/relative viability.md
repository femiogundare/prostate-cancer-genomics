### Relative Viability
<p>Cell viability is a measure of the proportion of live, healthy cells within a population. Cell viability assays are used to determine the overall health of cells, optimize culture or experimental conditions, and to measure cell survival following treatment with compounds, such as during a drug screen.</p>

<p>Typically, cell viability assays provide a readout of cell health through measurement of metabolic activity, ATP content, or cell proliferation. Cell viability can also be assessed using cell toxicity assays that provide a readout on markers of cell death, such as a loss of membrane integrity.</p>

<p>Together, cell viability and cell toxicity assays are important tools for assessing cellular responses to experimental compounds of interest.</p>

### What is Enzalutamide?
Enzalutamide, sold under the brand name Xtandi, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) medication which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer. It is indicated for use in conjunction with castration in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).
Men whose prostate cancer has stopped responding to other types of hormone therapy are usually offered enzalutamide. Enzalutamide can be used as an antiandrogen in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women.

### Dosage forms
* Tablet
* Capsule, liquid filled.

### How does it work?
Enzalutamide works by blocking the effect of the hormone testosterone on prostate cancer cells. Without testosterone, the prostate cancer cells canâ€™t grow, even if they have spread to other parts of the body.

### Enzalutamide as a first treatment
Some men may be offered enzalutamide when they are first diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. This type of prostate cancer is also referred to as hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, as the cancer is likely to respond to standard hormone therapy.

### Other treatment options
* Abiraterone
* Chemotherapy (docetaxel or cabazitaxel)
* Steroids
* Radium-223
* Less commonly, oestrogens.

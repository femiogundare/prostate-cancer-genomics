### Immunoblotting

<p>Immunoblotting (western blotting) is a widely used analytical technique in molecular biology and immunogenetics to detect specific proteins in a sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It has been useful in identifying specific antigens recognized by polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies and is highly sensitive (1 ng of antigen can be detected). It involves the solubilization and electrophoretic separation of proteins, glycoproteins, or lipopolysaccharides by gel electrophoresis, followed by quantitative transfer and irreversible binding to nitrocellulose, PVDF, or nylon.</p>

<p>A synthetic or animal-derived antibody (known as the primary antibody) is created that recognizes and binds to a specific target protein. The electrophoresis membrane is washed in a solution containing the primary antibody, before excess antibody is washed off. A secondary antibody is added which recognizes and binds to the primary antibody. The secondary antibody is visualized through various methods such as staining, immunofluorescence, and radioactivity, allowing indirect detection of the specific target protein.</p>

<p>Gel electrophoresis is one of the numerous procedures used in immunoblotting.</p>

<p>The immunoblotting technique uses 3 mechanisms to accomplish its task:</p>
* separation by size
* transfer to a solid support
* marking target protein using a proper primary and secondary antibody to visualize.

### Whole exome sequencing

<p>Whole-exome sequencing is a widely used next-generation sequencing (NGS) method that involves sequencing the protein-coding regions of the genome. The human exome represents less than 2% of the genome, but contains ~85% of known disease-related variants, making this method a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome sequencing.</p>

<p>Exome sequencing using exome enrichment can efficiently identify coding variants across a broad range of applications, including population genetics, genetic disease, and cancer studies.</p>

#### Advantages
* Identifies variants across a wide range of applications
* Achieves comprehensive coverage of coding regions
* Provides a cost-effective alternative to whole-genome sequencing (4–5 Gb of sequencing per exome compared to ~90 Gb per whole human genome)
* Produces a smaller, more manageable data set for faster, easier data analysis compared to whole-genome approaches

#### Efficient Analysis of Coding Regions
<p>Exome sequencing is a cost-effective approach when whole-genome sequencing is not practical or necessary. Sequencing only the coding regions of the genome enables researchers to focus their resources on the genes most likely to affect phenotype, and offers an accessible combination of turnaround time and price.</p>

<p>Exome sequencing detects variants in coding exons, with the capability to expand targeted content to include untranslated regions (UTRs) and microRNA for a more comprehensive view of gene regulation. DNA libraries can be prepared in as little as 1 day and require only 4–5 Gb of sequencing per exome.</p>
